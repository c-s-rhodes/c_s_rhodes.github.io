The determination of position during metazoan growth appears complex, in part, because we observe that growth does not occur at a constant rate, as temperatures fluctuate, so do the growth rates. One positioning method, a moving reference frame (MRF), is used in engineering, and navigation, to assign positions when velocity and changes in velocity are considerations. The use of a biological MRF employing Hox proteins to control position of cells along an axis is suggested, by the temporal-spatial expression patterns of the Hox proteins,[1, 2] and the effects of Hox proteins on cell divisions. [3, 4] A MRF simultaneously controlling both gene transcription and cell divisions when coupled with a series of asymmetric cell division seems sufficient to determine exact cellular positions along an axis of growth and account for many described homeotic morphological variations.[5]<br />
The Hox proteins, a large family of transcription regulatory factors that contain a conserved DNA-binding domain, the homeobox, are involved in determining the position and appearance of morphological structures in all metazoans. Complex and dramatic phenotypic changes are produced by alterations in Hox proteins, however, these phenotypes might be due to a pivotal role of the Hox proteins in the first steps of a series of developmental steps, [6, 7] each subsequent step of which is dependent upon the previous. Hox genes are arranged along chromosomes in groups, and during the formation of a morphological axis, such as the major body axis during gastrulation, or the limb axis during limb bud outgrowth, a series of Hox genes are expressed in the same sequential order as positioned along a chromosome, termed co-linearity.[1, 2]<br />
First described during the cataloging of discontinuous morphological variations, the positions of morphological structures change, but frequently change in a particular manner in relationship to their positions in related body plans; predominately, either moving forward along an axis, “from behind traveling forward”, a forward homeosis, or backward along an axis “from before traveling backward” a backward homeosis.[5] Mutations in gene complexes controlling segmentation,[8] now identified as invertebrate Hox genes, and alterations in the expression of vertebrate Hox genes,[9, 10] can alter the positions of morphological domains along axes, by moving domains forward or backward along along as axis.<br />
Grow th of metazoans along an axis can be represented geometrically. Suppose that growth is occurring along a straight line and a coordinate line is introduced in the direction of growth along the axis (Fig. 1a). Imagine a clock to keep track of the elapsed time, starting with t = 0 initially, and after seconds have elapsed the growth tip is s units from the origin (Fig. 1b). Because s changes with t, the position coordinate s is some function of t, that is<br />
<br />
s = ƒ(t)                                                        (1.1)<br />
<br />
The graph of this function with the t axis horizontal and s axis vertical is a position versus time curve. Since reports have not indicated that cell sizes are varying along an axis, nor is displacement occurring, we can represent distance in a kinematic analysis along a morphological axis by<br />
<br />
s = ƒ(cell lengths + cellular spacing)     (1.2)<br />
<br />
Distance s is represented as a function of both total number of cell lengths (total cell divisions) a sum quantity of gene expression controlling the extracellular spacing that has occurred.<br />
Principally, two types of models either gradient or progressive ordering models (proximal-distal ordering[11] and progress zone PZ[12]), have been proposed for determining cellular positions along a morphological axis and have been reviewed recently,[13-15] so only a brief description with a focus on rate change effects is presented. The gradient model suggests that after some unknown amount of growth or distance, s, position is determined by a direct relationship to the concentration of a substance or morphogen, termed an isomorphic position determination. (Fig. 1c) However, observations indicate that cell divisions are occurring all along an embryonic axis, such as a limb.[11, 16] Importantly, note the effect that variations in either cell divisions or gene expression, such as might be due to changes in temperature, have on position from the position versus time graph. If growth fluctuations within the gradient occur, the relationships of cells to the gradient will also be altered, and positions will vary with time.<br />
During the initial embryonic stages most evidence seems to suggest that growth occurs with a sequential ordering of cells along the limb[11, 17] and body axis[18, 19], the chronological assignment of early positional values then may determine the final ordering of morphological structures.[11, 12, 20] A progress zone (PZ) model, was proposed in which an autonomous timing mechanism assigns positional values during the process of embryonic limb outgrowth.[12] Three requirements were proposed for this PZ timing mechanism: a positional value, a positional signal and some as yet unknown relationship of cell division to position. In support of the PZ hypothesis, each of a series sequentially arranged Hox genes was expressed in an ordinal manner along the limb axis, and each Hox gene product was first detected at the distal margin, possibly the PZ, of embryonic chick limbs [21] suggesting that cryptic Hox activation events occurred at the limb growth margins. These events might be interpreted to indicate that Hox proteins are directly involved in regulating gene expression during the initial stages of embryonic limb development. As indicated by equation 1.2, determining position during growth requires controlling cell divisions and gene expression in a simultaneous manner.<br />
Similar to the PZ model, we came to understand a MRF model for the HOX code by applying our understanding of navigational methods, and methods used in engineering to analyze field events in conditions with velocity (Fig. 1d, see also Fig. 1b). Foremost, we sought to reduce the effects that changes in the growth rates might have on positional determinations, similar to the PZ conceptions. In engineering, the use of a moving reference frame is well understood, MRFs are applied to the analysis of events with spatial field coordinates that occur near objects that are moving with constant velocity and function to keep time from appearing in the independent variable of governing equations. For example, consider the analysis of a moving heat source in a solid, in this case the temperature field is a function of both spatial coordinates and time.[22] By the introduction of a moving frame of velocity that coincides with that of the moving heat source, time is eliminated as a variable from the second order partial differential equation, the velocity of the heat source becomes a parameter in the differential equation written in terms that describe the moving frame and alters the determinants of the temperature field. With this scheme, time variations in the governing equation(s) to cell divisions and gene expression would be removed and the theoretical subordinate governing equation(s), regulating secondary and subsequent cell divisions and gene expression events, are determined using initial coordinates only, i.e., x, y, z.<br />
The importance of the initial position assignment by controlled cell divisions and gene expression, and role of position in defining subordinate decisions is shown diagrammatically as domain shifts that would result from mutations in Hox genes. (Fig. 2a-c). One class of homeotic phenotypes, a backward homeosis, that suggests the reiteration of a morphological domain and might be expected to extend the total amount of axial growth allowed, when compared to a representative body plan, was specifically sought out in phenotypic variation studies of morphology.[5] Presently, allowing extensive additional cells along an axis such as is the case by forming or extending morphological domains to include cellular regions do not appear in a representative adult, suggests the occurrence of neoplastic events (Fig. 2c). Phocomelic dysmorphologies that can be described by developmental models,[11, 23] are anticipated by described homeotic variations.[5] A MRF model suggests that the antitumor effects of thalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma[24] could be caused by altering both the relationships gene expression and controlled cell divisions simultaneously (Fig. 2c). Because the DNA targets for  the different Hox proteins  are very similar, or the same, in each repeating morphological domain, minor alterations of a target regulatory region would also be expected. (Fig. 2d). In these cases a  structure or organ that is normally positioned in the d2 Hox domain could be shifted to an earlier  d1 domain, or shifted to a later td domain; respectively, either a backward homeosis or a forward homeosis, with alterations in cis as causes.  Space-time constraints prohibit  retrospect initialization of position during the extension of morphological axes.<br />
Consider the application of MRF concepts and classical mechanics to identifying related positions in metazoans. If we assign t0= 0 at the beginning of a morphological segment and apply two different MRFs, K and Kƒ, and suppose that the MRFs are coincident at t0 and Kƒ is moving at constant velocity v greater than K, then normally during conditions of constant velocity the coordinate of an event in K at time t and position x are given in Kƒ by a Galilean transformation for changing over from one body of reference to another. The algebraic representation is<br />
<br />
xƒ = x - v(t1 – t0)                         (1.3)<br />
