The determination of position during metazoan growth appears complex, in part, because we observe that growth does not occur at a constant rate, as temperatures fluctuate, so do the growth rates. One positioning method, a moving reference frame (MRF), is used in engineering, and navigation, to assign positions when velocity and changes in velocity are considerations. The use of a biological MRF employing Hox proteins to control position of cells along an axis is suggested, by the temporal-spatial expression patterns of the Hox proteins,[1, 2] and the effects of Hox proteins on cell divisions. [3, 4] A MRF simultaneously controlling both gene transcription and cell divisions when coupled with a series of asymmetric cell division seems sufficient to determine exact cellular positions along an axis of growth and account for many described homeotic morphological variations.[5]<br />
